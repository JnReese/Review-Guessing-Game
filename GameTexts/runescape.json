  "posted: february 27, 2021\nas an on and off player for 10+ years i would not recommend this game. it is by far the most addictive game that i have ever played and it will make you feel like you must play even if you don't want to. it is not like other games where you have phases of playing a lot and then just stop. i only ever stopped playing if my account got banned.\n\nto become absolutely anything on this game you must spend sickening amounts of time 'grinding' clicking on virtual rocks, trees, places on the map etc. just search how much time it physically takes to get 99s (the highest level in any skill) on the game.\n\na steam user @flirwn in these reviews commented :\n\n'_________ does nothing more than act as a sink for your productivity and time, making you less successful in your life. this is why most players of this game are unhappy, because they are unhappy with their lives as they aren't achieving anything in them, and are using this game as a coping mechanism to feel productive'\n\ni cannot agree more!\n\nthese factors make this the perfect tool for filling in voids in people's lives. anyone prone to depression, or with an addictive personality should definitely not play. this game will actually suck days out of your life and you'll only look back in regret, praying that you could get those precious hours back. please take this advice."
