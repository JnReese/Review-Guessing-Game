  "posted: july 4, 2020\nfor those who enjoy the addiction that the assurance of incremental improvement and repetition provide then look no further. there is an enormous amount of fun here for those of us who like to do the same thing over and over again whilst expecting slightly different results. the playing of video games does often require a mindset of stubborn optimism and suspension of disbelief for which we are rewarded by being able to progress in a way that is more obvious and measurable than in real life. this game satisfies that part of our mind that realises that time is indeed to be wasted on idle and fruitless pursuits. in return for our wasteful nihilsm, we might be rewarded with the perverse pleasure that addicitve video gaming can bring. your brain will be so engaged by the all encompassing gameplay that the rest of existence will smply become peripheral. so, yes, there is enjoyment to be had here but don't blame me if you suddenly realise, several months from now, that you wasted the best part of your summer playing an invidious deck builder instead of going out and living your life. it is, therefore, highly recommended for play during a pandemic!"
