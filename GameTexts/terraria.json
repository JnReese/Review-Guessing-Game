  "posted: may 4, 2015\nthis is a review seeing just how terrible minecraft is in terms of content in comparison to _________.\n\nit's bad.\nspecial note: this was made as of _________ 1.2 and i'm way too lazy to update it\n\n\nitems\nmc items: 350\n_________ items: 3646\n\n\nenemies\nmc enemies: 21\n_________ enemies: 401\n\n\nbosses\nmc bosses: 2\n_________ bosses: 29\n\n\npotions\nmc potions: 13\n_________ potions: 76\n\n\nweapons\nmc weapons (varieties): 6\n_________ weapons (varieties): 360\n(5 swords, 1 bow, vs. 77 swords, 38 bows, 20 yoyos, 17 spears, 11 boomerangs, 13, flails, 5 \"other melee\", 60 guns, 28 staffs, 9 tomes of magic, 14 \"other magic\", 17 summon weapons, 31 thrown weapons, 4 turrets, 16 waraxes)\n\n\npets\nmc pets*: 2\n_________ pets: 44\n\n\nmounts\nmc mounts*: 3\n_________ mounts: 11\n(*including tameable mobs and rideable mobs)\n\non to my personal opinion (if you really do care): mixed opinions. i prefer minecraft for the building and the survival. _________ has a good array of things you can use to build but i like to use minecraft because of the complexity of machinery you can make using all the complicated gizmos and gadgets in it. as for survival, it's exceptionally fun in _________ but i like it in minecraft as well due to the sheer size and randomness of a world. in _________ everything is more or less always the same; corruption/crimson, hell, space, etc. but in minecraft there are so many more places to choose from! but all the same, _________ can be fun too.\n\nso, opinions aside, due to our comparisons...\n_________ wins!...\n...right?\n\nyou see, it isn't about who has more of what. it's about the way to play. the way to enjoy it. you enjoy building, being creative, making pixel art? play minecraft, it's the perfect game for you. don't have much taste for being a super builder, but like adventuring, fighting, bosses, etcetera? play _________.\n\n\n...or uninstall both and get a job, loser",
