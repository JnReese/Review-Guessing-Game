  "posted: september 25, 2015\nno, i would not recommend this game to anyone, for any reason. at the tail end of of almost a thousand hours, and after careful deliberation, i cannot find anything redeeming in ____________. not its single-player, not it's multi-player, certainly not its tower defense, not its loot mechanics, and, most assuredly, not its community. the whole ____________ experience, from the first achievement for simply following a tutorial, to the last achievement in killing four giant snowmen and an alcoholic santa claus, is garbage.\n\nlet me get this out of the way – the original thirteen maps of ____________ and the original four classes, they're fine. the original, vanilla ____________ experience, although simplistic, has a very clear and defined progression. your four classes – the apprentice, the squire, the huntress, and the monk – are fairly well balanced for both solo play and multiplayer, and because you can swap characters during maps in solo play, you can make doubly strong defense setups with combinations from those four classes. it is entirely possible, with good tower strategies, to go from the beginning of the game to the end of the game – that is, from deeper well to glitterhelm caverns - all on the same difficulty with hardly any farming, up to the tail end of insane difficulty. the original ____________, simplistic it may be, is roughly fifty hours of a tight tower defense experience with a lot of experimentation possible within it.\n\nenter nightmare. enter spiders, enter djinns, and enter sharkens. which, alright, those aren't bad. these are enemies that are designed to target and disrupt your defenses so that you'd have to reconsider your defense setups. up to insane, you weren't really punished for not using all four classes, so nightmare is the point where the game decides to kick you around a bit and force you to play it better. so, you'll go back and level up a new class to use in conjunction with your usual class and take another crack at it.\n\nso with a format like this, how did this game get screwed so badly?\n\ndlc upon dlc happened, ramping the game's difficulty by numbers up faster than players could keep up with it. you could gotten away with playing with lower stats if it weren't for the sky city patch that introduced goblin copters. goblin copters dropping their buffed up ogres on your defenses alone increased the minimum stat requirements for maps by quite a bit. after that, maps began spamming ogres ad nauseum just as a difficulty supplement rather than having actual difficulty within the map's designs. suddenly, people couldn't keep up with the game's difficulty without farming late waves of survival mode for incrementally better gear. but the random number generator was bugged, so it wasn't giving out progressively stronger gear as often as it should have been. and so, people spent more time farming in the game than they do actually progressing in it.\n\nentire class dlcs – the series ev, the jester, and the summoner – were released just to keep the game possible to beat, rather than to supplement the game with new and interesting ways to play it. by the real end of the game, those classes are a requirement to succeed. if you favored the squire or the apprentice when you began playing the game, they are going to gather dust in your character roster because the real end of the game doesn't even have actual tower defense in the way that the very first thirteen maps do.\n\nlet's also keep in mind that most of the dlc is outsourced to the winners of map contests held by trendy on their official ____________ forums (that unnavigable mess) and other dlcs are very clearly sourced to a different set of developers from the initial game. what this means is that there's a ton of maps in the game that have an inconsistent graphical quality and difficulty – difficulty, by the way, at this point rarely amounts to anything more than using the same three correct classes over and over in the correct spots with no room for experimentation. then, those maps take anywhere from twenty to forty minutes at a time because of rapidly inflating mob counts per wave.\n\nlook, i get that a difficulty name like “nightmare” means, okay, the game is going to be hard now, and that naturally does mean you're going to need higher stats to beat older maps, as well as be pretty damn tough in order to meet the requirements of the endgame. that's standard difficulty in game design. and ____________ does that! initially, nightmare mode challenges your perception of building maps to compensate for spiders dropping in behind your defenses, sharkens who can charge in and completely push them out of the way, and djinns who can just outright destroy them.\n\nbut, the metagame changed. suddenly, the solution is always a line of summons on a buff beam underneath a stack of auras. every special mob and the threat presents is handled by that solution alone. and with that one-size fits all solution, it becomes the only solution that maps are designed around. difficulty is reduced to a stat requirement on a board that says, “here. this is how difficult it is, this is what kind of numbers you need to scrape by on the skin of your teeth with, this is what kind of numbers you need to beat it comfortably and farm it, and this is what kind of super low number you can beat it with to stroke your epeen. these are the points you need to put on the dlc summoner, the dlc series ev, the monk, and the huntress. haha, what? apprentice and squire? those aren't relevant.” and that says nothing of building a character for tackling bosses.\n\nonce you get somewhere new in ____________, get comfortable. you're gonna be there for a while, until you get lucky. by a trendy developer's own admission, the stats on drops are bugged so that they rollover – become worse than they should be when they're spawned – and thus the progression is more restrictive than it was ever intended to be. and indeed, dlc was released to try and get around that too. but dlc can't fix a fundamentally broken game, and in fact, it actually broke it more, because the loot coming out of it was too god, so it came out gimped, per that bug.\n\nit is actually to the point where, in order to maximize your chances of getting loot that will give you better stats, and thus, help you move forward, an x-box controller emulator was devised in order to take advantage of splitscreen. this is so you can have four chances at a map's rewards, rather than just the one, for your thirty minute run of what-the-hell-ever map. and i expect that this tool was only ever intended for the obsessive munchkin crowd, but it rapidly turned into a requirement to proceed at all in the game.\n\nthis is not tower defense. this is just farming and reaping the rewards of poor soil.\n\nso, now that you understand what a majority of ____________ is, i want you to take a look at the most helpful (all time) reviews here on steam for this game. most of them are from people with people whose hours number in the multiple thousands. i hope that at least explaining the arbitrary farming puts into context those hours.\n\n____________, even with all its dlc, does not have nearly enough content to justify those lengths of time, or, hell, even my own, and by its own design, it's not a game i could recommend to anyone.\n\nit's a bad game.",
