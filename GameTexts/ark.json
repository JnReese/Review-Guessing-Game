  "posted: june 24, 2015\nearly access review\n-spawned in the game for my very first time\n-cried a bit since the game runs pretty bad (though i know it will get better, but it is still playable)\n-started learning controls and running around\n-saw a big rock and thought \"nice, maybe i can use this as a weapon!\"\n-upon closer inspection, it was dinosaur poop\n-thought i could maybe throw poop at other people or dinosaurs\n-couldn't figure out how to equip poop\n-clicked on poop in inventory, clicked \"use item\"\n-by clicking on \"use item\", i thought it would allow me to put it in my hand, to wield the poop\n-apparently that made me eat the poop\n-died from poop\n\nnote to self: do not click \"use item\" on poop or other dangerous items.\n\n\nupdate: a fellow \"gamer\" messaged me and complained this wasn't a review and \"reported\" me because of it.\n\nso specifically to that person, and to anyone else who has no sense of humor, here is a review.\n\nreview: the game is fun. it has dinosaurs. it has poop. you have big poops and small poops. i can poop and my dinosaur can poop next to me. or i can ride him and make him poop.\n\ngame doesn't run the best of course. highest amount of frames i get is 30 with a mix of settings, but mainly everything on medium, with some ultra.\n\nwill you like this game?\nyes, if you like dinosaurs, base building and pooping.\n\nstop talking about poop, will i like this game?\nyes, if you like dinosaurs.\n\nstop talking about dinosaurs, will i like this game?\nyes, you can poop.",

  "posted: june 7, 2015\nearly access review\nmy day began as anyone else's i foraged for food, mere berries to sustain me. i punched brittle trees for whatever materials i could break off to make a pickaxe.\n\nonce i had my bearings i killed ten people and ate them. still something was missing from my life so i made a nice house but it was still missing something... i made individual small rooms and put a small sign outside saying \"inn\" i offered free food and tools for any and all.\n\nbut as i sunk deeper into mania i locked my prisoners uh... guests, in their rooms never to leave again. offering them nothing to eat but black berries and severe beatings.\n\nsome of them did not like this. \"stop\" they screamed \"let me out\"\ni did not fully understand them, why would they betray me like this... no, how dare they.\n\n\nthe inn of no return. \na screenshot of _________: survival evolved\nby: umbraldweller\n\n\nafter five or so victims forever imprisoned, i decided it was time to move on, leaving them to their fate. after some time i came across a beach of many houses, 6 people in all, each one sleeping. one by one i dragged them into the ocean and fed them to the megaladons.\n\n\nthis is what happens when you stay at my inn. you get to enjoy the aquarium! \na screenshot of _________: survival evolved\nby: umbraldweller\n\n\n\nthe final sacrifice. \na screenshot of _________: survival evolved\nby: umbraldweller\n\n\ni left one alive... with a message.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=457298134\n\n11/10 - would become a serial killer again.\n\nperhaps now would be a good time to extend an invitation to you all to come to my hotel which is not infact some sort of \"death stadium\" where you enter only to be trapped with spears lunged at you from above while t-rex's chase you, because that would be absurd and unethical as i am all about the ethics you see.\n\n----------\n\nin all seriousness _________ is a great game with a lot of potential! even my review shows thats its possible to be quite creative in _________ and that especially on pvp servers its important to log out somewhere safe as you persist in the game!\n\nremember when your parents told you not to trust strangers especially weirdos, well when someone dangles some meat in front of you as an incentive to enter their d_________ opressive inn leading you into a small room, thats what they meant, you killed yourself not me!\n\nfurthermore it has a rather expansive crafting and stat system already~ progressing you from that primative on the beach who just discovered fire to that high tech hunter and his crew with their immense stronghold, gatling guns and dinosaur dwellings, performing air raids on the backs of screechers parachuting into enemy territory!",

  "posted: june 11, 2015\nearly access review\nday 1 : girl drugged me, pooped on my body and called me a noob. several days later, i come across a small pond with a megalodon in it. i make a small offering here and there, the megalodon and i bond. he says he will offer me great power for a human sacrifice. day 16: i track down the girl who had once defecated on my face. i see her attempting to tame a stego. i sneak up on her. load her with 30 drug berries, kill the stego she is taming, poop on it's body. drag her lifeless corpse back to lord megalodon, he seems pleased. i drag her to the beach. add 10 more drug berries, just to make sure she is helpless. i throw her body in with lord megalodon. he seems pleased, but he requires more. i begin my hunt again. 10/10",
